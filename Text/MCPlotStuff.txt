## PrologueEnding

[Left][LoadLeeroy]
[Right]
Alright. Now that those mooks are dealt[N]
with, let us kill the Demon King.[AN]
[Left]
No, Void. There's still[N]
29 chapters of mooks to go.[AN]
[Right]
WHAT?! I want to kill
the Demon King now.
[Left]
Unfortunately, that is presently[N]
not possible. When the Demon King[AN]
killed your father, he took the only[N]
weapon able to kill him, the Super[AN]
Blitz. I hazard a guess it'll take[N]
roughly a full fan hack to re-obtain[AN]
it so we can actually kill the Demon King.[AN]
[Right]
Leeroy, sometimes I hate you.[A]
[Left]
It's part of the job, Void.[A][X]

[Left][LoadMyrmAnna]
I'd love to help you, but one[N]
of my sisters left something[AN]
very important in the nest of[N]
a terrifying Draco Zombie...[AN]
or are they Necro Dragons now?[N]
Besides, I'm a [Red]Secret Unit.[Red][AN]
Regardless, help me out,[N]
and I can help you out.[AN][X]

## RecruitingMyrmAnna
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadMyrmAnna]
MY CARD! Thank you for retrieving[N]
it for me. Now I'll just take that[AN]
card from you... I'm Anna. Some[N]
like to call me the Secret Seller,[AN]
and you should know we traders[N]
make some VERY deep cuts.[A][X]

## Ch1Ending
[Left][LoadBreguet]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Well, uh, that is something, kid.[A]
[Left]
You needed a road.[N]
I gave you one.[A]
Void: Fair enough.[A][X]

## Ch2Opening
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
[OpenLeft][LoadBede]
Excuse me miss.[A]
[Right]
Who are you? If you stay in[N]
my way, then prepare to pay.[A]
[Left]
I am Bede, a handsome curate. I[N]
cannot fight, and because of this[AN]
I cannot defeat the Brigands in[N]
the fort to the south. Please help me.[AN]
[Right]
Only if you work for me afterwards.[A]
[Left]
Deal.[A][X]

## Ch2VillageConvo1
[Right][LoadCurrent]
Hey, look! A thing![A][X]

## Ch2ArchRant
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadArch]
Back in my day, we weren't making[N]
hacks super lightning fast. No. We[AN]
made hacks with time, effort, and[N]
many, many delays. So what if our[AN]
hacks never finished? So what if[N]
Elibean Nights is still in hiatus?[AN]
When that famous date of 2020 finally[N]
arrives, and Elibean Nights finally[AN]
releases, it'll be something of[N]
value, not something made on the[AN]
cheap. What, are we Maeda now,[N]
getting things out fast as possible[AN]
to make a quick buck? No! I refuse[N]
to accept it. Hacks and Fire Emblem [AN]
used to have dignity and honor, but no,[N]
now that we are fucking mainstream,[AN]
we've got goddamn quotas to meet.[N]
Why does everyone go sorry with age?[AN]
I remember the good old days before[N]
the Maeda attacked. Sure, our group[AN]
was much smaller, but we had heart,[N]
dreams, and soul, and by God we-[AN]
[Right]
SHUT UP![A]
[Left]
AHHH! Someone's here![A]
[Clear]
[Right]
Hey, he dropped something.[A][X]

## Ch2Ending
[Left][LoadBede]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Well, that was easy.[A]
[Left]
Thank you, Void. As thanks,[N]
I will serve as your advisor and[AN]
as a healer from now on.[A]
[Right]
Cool; let's go.[A][X]

## Ch4Opening
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Who are those men guarding that castle?[A]
[Left]
The Donateenries ma'am, an[N]
evil cult who revived the[AN]
Demon King by donating to the[N]
Feditor God, Hex. They say even[AN]
now they seek someone with[N]
Major Hex Holy Blood to[AN]
revive their unholy God.[AN]
[Right]
They revived the Demon King...[N]
The Demon King killed my family,[AN]
and they WANT that monster to[N]
return to this world. What possible--[AN]
[Left]
They are generic anime villains ma'am,[N]
they don't have a reason to do so.[AN]
[Right]
...We're not in a good story, are we?[AN]
[Left]
Quantity over Quality.[AN][X]

## Ch4NotArchRecruitment
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadArch]
I heard this hack needed a good[N]
mage. Well, my Divine Lightning[AN]
pierces the skies, and I'm happy[N]
to help. Why are you staring at[AN]
me? You're expecting me to rant? I[N]
don't know what you're talking about![A][X]

## Ch4Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
That was the power of the Donateenaries?[N]
Ha, what a joke. Alas, they were in my[AN]
way, so they had to pay.[AN][X]

## Ch5Opening
[Right][LoadVoid]
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
My lady! WE'VE GOT TROUBLE![A]
[Right]
What, Leeroy?[A]
[Left]
The Donateenaries want revenge[N]
and attacked, and what's worse,[AN]
we've been separated from the[N]
rest of our forces.[AN]
[Right]
Our only chance is to regroup[N]
and seize their base. Ready, MOVE![AN][X]

## RecruitingKirsten
[Right][LoadCurrent]
PLACEHOLDER[A][X]

## Ch5Ending
[Left][LoadBede]
[FarLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[MidRight][LoadVoid]
That was... surprising.[A]
[FL]
Indeed, let us be more[N]
careful in the future.[AN]
[MR]
Right. But how did the Donateenaries[N]
change the weather, though?[AN]
[Left]
I assume it must be the unholy[N]
tome Naglfar, said to be the[AN]
by-product of some unholy demon[N] 
known as FEditor, now known as[AN]
the Demon King. FEditor gave the[N]
tome of Naglfar to the unholy[AN]
bloodline of his evil god Hex[N]
in order to protect their followers.[AN]
[MR]
So the Demon King merely[N]
serves Hex then?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, the Demon King is more akin[N]
to an angel than a demon, an[AN]
eternal servant to the evil god.[N]
The very same god vanquished[AN]
by the great gods, the league of FEU.[AN]
[MR]
The league of FEU. My family[N]
told me about them before...[AN]
[Left]
Yes, the League of FEU. It is[N]
said you descend from one of[AN]
the League's Gods, and as such[N]
you can wield the fabled[AN]
Super Blitz Lance.[AN]
[MR]
The holy weapon of the League[N]
God Babby, the Super Blitz...[AN]
[Left]
Void, it is your duty to prevent the Demon[N]
King from reviving the Evil God Hex.[AN][X]
