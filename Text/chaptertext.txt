To get to him I need[N]
to go through you![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
That village looks nice.[N]
Those horses don't.[AN]
[MidRight]
And one of those horses[N]
is looking fancy.[AN]
LEEROY...[A][X]

##Ch3SecondScene
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x33][0x1]

I see Void's army![N]
Time to earn some gold![AN]
I also have a horseslayer.[N]

him down![A][X]

##GettingJay
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0xF][0x1]
What's all this racket?[N]
I can't compile my project.[AN]
I've still got some research[N]
on this fair tale's graphic[AN]
compression format, plus I still[N]
need Boo's script. Who are you?[AN]
You're fighting against the Demon[N]
King? Maybe I'll run into my[AN]
man on the way. Name's Jay,[N]

Idiotic Jenkins. I, Leeroy,[N]
am the only person able to[AN]
charge in without care![N]
Your weapon is now mine.[AN]
[MidRight]
You should be more careful.[N]
Horseslayers, knight killers,[AN]
ridersbanes, beast killers,[N]
halberds, poleaxes, and more[AN]
cause lots of trouble for you.[N]
No matter. Onwards we go![A][X]
