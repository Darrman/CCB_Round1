[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
The Demon King killed my family[N]
and took over my country![AN]
To get to him I need[N]
to go through you![A][X]


##Ch3Start
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x4][0x1]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
That village looks nice.[N]
Those horses don't.[AN]
[MidRight]
And one of those horses[N]
is looking fancy.[AN]
LEEROY...[A][X]

##Ch3SecondScene
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x33][0x1]
Hehehe...[A]
I see Void's army![N]
Time to earn some gold![AN]
I also have a horseslayer.[N]
Leeroy is gonna be history![AN]
I, Jenkins, will strike[N]
him down![A][X]

##GettingJay
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0xF][0x1]
What's all this racket?[N]
I can't compile my project.[AN]
I've still got some research[N]
on this fair tale's graphic[AN]
compression format, plus I still[N]
need Boo's script. Who are you?[AN]
You're fighting against the Demon[N]
King? Maybe I'll run into my[AN]
man on the way. Name's Jay,[N]
by the way. Fear my Continue![A][X]

##Ch3Ending

[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1]
Idiotic Jenkins. I, Leeroy,[N]
am the only person able to[AN]
charge in without care![N]
Your weapon is now mine.[AN]
[MidRight]
You should be more careful.[N]
Horseslayers, knight killers,[AN]
ridersbanes, beast killers,[N]
halberds, poleaxes, and more[AN]
cause lots of trouble for you.[N]
No matter. Onwards we go![A][X]

##Ch8Start2
[MidLeft][LoadVirginia]
[MidRight][LoadPrine]
Hey! You guys don't look like[N]
the soldiers trying to kill me.[AN]
Think you could help me out a bit[N]
here? Though I'd like to think[AN]
that I could hold my own...[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course. These soldiers are[N]
in my way anyway. Disposing of[AN]
them is only natural.[AN]
Everyone, get ready![A][X]

##Ch8Left
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]

Aw man, did you mess up my garden[N]
on your way in here?[AN]
I spend so much time making[N]

Well, I guess I won't need[N]
this anymore. I was going to[AN]
use it as an ornament...[A][X]

##Ch10PostBattleText1
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Phew. That was a tough battle.[N]
But we got through it all the same.[AN]
Alright everyone, it's time to go.[N]
The Demon King won't slay himself![AN]
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x16][0x1]
You're going to slay the Demon King?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Samson? Ah, yes. That is the plan.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I see. In that case, allow me to join[N]
you and add my bow to this cause.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You would help us? Really?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course. I hate the Demon King[N]
as much as you do. I wish to have[AN]
a hand in bringing about his end.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I don't see why not.[N]
Welcome aboard, Samson![A][X]
