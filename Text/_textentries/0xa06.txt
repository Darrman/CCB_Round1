[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x62][0x1]
Over a few hundred miles away[N]
is a fierce battle. There's[A]
a powerful company, Intelligent[N]
Systems, who control a thing[A]
called "Fire Emblem". Now[N]
Fire Emblem was created by[A]
a man named Kaga. However,[N]
Kaga's a bit nuts. Incest,[A]
slave dancers, poor balance,[N]
the works. However, he was[A]
recently ousted and exiled.[N]
Fire Emblem is now run by[A]
a man named Maeda. Maeda...[N]
After the exile, things[A]
weren't too bad. Elibe,[N]
Magvel, Tellius... Then[A]
the return to Akaneia[N]
happened. Kris. Maeda.[A]
Doom. Timeskip. Awakening.[N]
Timetravel. Waifus. Thorp.[A]
Now things are getting[N]
worse! Corrin! Revelations![A]
Extreme waifus! No lore![N]
Thankfully, an insider forced[A]
Maeda away from Valencia[N]
and Fire Emblem's getting[A]
better, but Maeda didn't[N]
take it well. He has cursed[A]
Kaga into being a dancer.[N]
He says it was revenge for[A]
the slave dancer girls...[N]
Please! Save Kaga![A][X]
